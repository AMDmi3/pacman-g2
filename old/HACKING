./configure options
===================

For developers, using

./configure --enable-werror --enable-debug --disable-doxygen --disable-fakeroot \
--disable-po4a --disable-python --disable-perl --disable-java --disable-csharp

is highly recommended.

How to test pacman-g2?
===================

Run the tests:

make check

NOTE: if you got FAILED for all test then try pacman-g2 -S fakeroot and try again :)

If some of them failed, probably you'll want to run only one test,
for example sync990:

cd pactest; python pactest.py --test=tests/sync990.py -p ../src/pacman-g2/pacman-g2 --debug=-1

That's all.

How to test pacman-g2 more using valgrind?
============================================

When using GDB or valgrind on pacman-g2, you will want to run it on the actual
binary rather than the shell script wrapper produced by libtool. The actual
binary lives at `src/pacman-g2/.libs/lt-pacman-g2, and will exist after running
`./src/pacman-g2/pacman-g2` at least once.

For example, to run valgrind:

    ./src/pacman-g2/pacman-g2
    valgrind --leak-check=full -- src/pacman-g2/.libs/lt-pacman-g2 -Syu

How should I make benchmarks?
=============================

pacman-g2 spends most time with reading and writing the database. because of
this, it's important to drop caches before doing a benchmark. here is how to do
so:

# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

How to add new localized manpage to pacman-g2 (configure and all things)
=====================================================================

You need to create a dir under doc/ with lang name. Lets see an example. You want to do
'de' translations. You need to create a doc/de/ <-- You need a Makefile.am here too.
Copy it from hu/Makefile.am and modify it to fit your translation settings. Need to modify
the install directory in here.

Next, you need to modify configure.ac. Search for 'doc/hu/Makefile' and add a line after that like
this: 'doc/de/Makefile'

If you want you can add 'rm -rf de/*.8' to doc/Makefile.am too but that is not a neccessary thing.

That's all. :P
