./configure options
===================

For developers, using

./configure --enable-werror --enable-debug --disable-doxygen --disable-fakeroot \
--disable-po4a --disable-python --disable-perl --disable-java --disable-csharp

is highly recommended.

How to test pacman-g2?
===================

Run the tests:

make check

NOTE: if you got FAILED for all test then try pacman-g2 -S fakeroot and try again :)

If some of them failed, probably you'll want to run only one test,
for example sync990:

cd pactest; python pactest.py --test=tests/sync990.py -p ../../src/pacman-g2/pacman-g2 --debug=-1

That's all.

How to test pacman-g2 more using valgrind?
=========================================

Try to run some commands using valgrind with a command like:

valgrind --leak-check=full --trace-children=yes -- src/pacman-g2/pacman-g2 -Syu

Be careful, valgrind reports lots of errors, even some errors that may not be related to
pacman-g2. You should have a little experience of valgrind to ignore the noise.

How to add new localized manpage to pacman-g2 (configure and all things)
=====================================================================

You need to create a dir under doc/ with lang name. Lets see an example. You want to do
'de' translations. You need to create a doc/de/ <-- You need a Makefile.am here too.
Copy it from hu/Makefile.am and modify it to fit your translation settings. Need to modify
the install directory in here.

Next, you need to modify configure.ac. Search for 'doc/hu/Makefile' and add a line after that like
this: 'doc/de/Makefile'

If you want you can add 'rm -rf de/*.8' to doc/Makefile.am too but that is not a neccessary thing.

That's all. :P
