./configure options
===================

For developers, using --enable-debug --disable-doxygen --disable-fakeroot
is highly recommended.

How to test pacman?
===================

First grab Aurelien Foret's pactest from
http://aurelien.foret.free.fr/archlinux/pactest/src/pactest-0.3.tar.gz

Then get the patch to add Frugalware support:
http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/pactest/pactest-0.3-frugalware.diff

I assume that you extracted pactest under <pacmandir>/pactest/pactest-0.3.

Now run the tests:

./pactest.py --test=tests/*.py -p ../../src/pacman/pacman --debug=-1

If some of them failed, probably you'll want to run only one test,
for example sync990:

./pactest.py --test=tests/sync990.py -p ../../src/pacman/pacman --debug=-1

That's all.

How to add new localized manpage to pacman (configure and all things)
=====================================================================

You need to create a dir under doc/ with lang name. Lets see an example. You want to do
'de' translations. You need to create a doc/de/ <-- You need a Makefile.am here too.
Copy it from hu/Makefile.am and modify it to fit your translation settings. Need to modify
the install directory in here.

Next, you need to modify configure.ac. Search for 'doc/hu/Makefile' and add a line after that like
this: 'doc/de/Makefile'

If you want you can add 'rm -rf de/*.8' to doc/Makefile.am too but that is not a neccessary thing.

That's all. :P
