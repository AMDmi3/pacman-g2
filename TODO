GLOBAL
======

- get ride of "ORE" tags.


LIBALPM
=======

- review errors handling (globalise pm_errno usage, improve error 
meanings)

- documentation (doxygen? man pages for public functions? ...)


PACMAN
======

- review how things are displayed in the frontend (normal display,
verbose mode, which usage for the library log callback, debug levels, ...)

- add .lastupdate files support for "files" db downloads

TRANSLATION
===========

po files
--------
cs.po - mail sent
es.po - created by Matt, pending
fr.po - mail sent
nl.po - mail sent
pl_PL.po - mail sent
pt_BR.po - mail sent
we need to mail them:
pt_PT.po
ru.po
sv.po
zh_CN.po

manpages
--------
we need to mail them:
es
hu - we need somebody who'll do the work
pl_PL
pt_BR
zh_CN

ADDITIONAL IDEAS FOR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
============================================

- idea from Christian Hamar: have a /var/lib/pacman/{repo}/.cache file
that basically contains the output of `ls -1 /var/lib/pacman/{repo}`.  This
cache file could be used in -Q and -Si/s operations to speed up package
listings.

G2 TODO
=======

- Review #1079 (BTS) and maybe implement it
- untouched dirs from pacman:
  - pamcan.conf, pacman.d
  - /var/lib/pacman, /var/cache/pacman

autoconf/automake
=================

pacman-g2's Makefile.am and configure.in
=====================================

- find out how can we prevent automake/autoconf to build pacman-g2.static binary, if we
  are configured using --disable-static flag. Now if builded with this option, then pacman-g2.static
  compile fails, because there will be no libalpm.a (just .so)

global
======

- review autoclean.sh script. Maybe there is a more simple way to do this FULL clean.

- Many things :)) If you got idea or request, then implement it.

libalpm and codechanges
=======================

- Add much more defines in configure.in via options or not. Like CACHEDIR, PKGEXT, etc.
  Those will be available from config.h so not need a big codechange. But it is usefull.
  The user can specify at the configure what cachedir or pkgext he/she want. And maybe better
  for other distros (like frugalware :) ) which are using other PKGEXT or cachedir than default.

- Review what needed to be in config.h and what not. Probably many #depends which are now hardcoded
  into the sources.
