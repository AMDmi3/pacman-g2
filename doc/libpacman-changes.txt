== NAME

libpacman-changes - Changelog for libpacman(3)

== SYNOPSIS

A attempt to have all the changes in API and behaviour of the libpacman over versions.

== Changes for version XXX

=== Dependency changes

==== FLib

A new private (for now) library that abstract some of the usual API a 'C' programmer need.

=== API changes

==== Symbols changed:

PM_LIST is now a flib FList meaning that pacman_list(3) API will be deprecated when FLib will be stabilized. 

==== Symbols added:

PM_PKG_DATABASE: New package data accessor.
PM_TRANS_FLAG_EXPLICIT: (internal) Specify the user added the package on purpose.

==== Symbols removed:

PM_PKG_DATA, PM_SYNC_DATA: These data accessors provided ambiguity in the API, returning value type was not consistant and was depending on other returned values.

PM_SYNC_TYPE_REPLACE, PM_SYNC_TYPE_UPGRADE, PM_SYNC_TYPE_DEPEND: One should use the PM_TRANS_TYPE_* equivalent instead.

pacman_pkg_checkmd5sum, pacman_pkg_checksha1sum: Unused and broken since a while and nobody noticed it, so it is unused (can can be easily replaced by other means).

=== Behaviour changes

PM_TRANS_CONV_REPLACE_PKG data3 third argument is now allways NULL, you can get the database and its name using PM_PKG_DATABASE.
